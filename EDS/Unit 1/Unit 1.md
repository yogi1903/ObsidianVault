**INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS**

## Feeder
1. Connects substation to the area where power is to be delivered
2. Connects generating station to the substation
3. Tappings are not taken from the feeder
4. Current remains same through the entire feeder
5. Current carrying capacity is the main concern when designing a feeder.

## Distributor 
1. Tappings are taken from this conductor
2. Current through the distributor is not constant due to the tappings
3. Voltage drop is the main concern when designing a distributor

## Service Mains
1. Connects distributor to Consumer's meter
2. Link between the distributor and consumer's terminal

## **Primary distribution system**- 11 KV or 6.6 KV or 3.3 KV
1. Commonly used Voltages are 11 KV or 6.6 KV or 3.3 KV
2. Handles large blocks of electrical energy when compared with low voltage consumer uses.
3. Power from generation station is transmitted at high voltage to the substations
4. Supplied to various substations or large consumers (industrial/commercial)
5. 33kv supplied to substation is converted to lower voltage.
## **Secondary distribution system**- 415 V or 230 V
1. Employs a 415/230w 4 wire 3 phase system.
2. This is the range of voltages the end consumer uses.


# Types of Distribution Systems
## 1. Radial System
1. Multiple distributors are fed by a single substation.
2. Single feeder between the substation and distributor
3. Power flows in a single path
4. interruptions cause complete loss of power to the customer
**Advantages**
- Low Cost
- Simple planning
**Disadvantages**
- Can only be used when substation is in the center of the load and generated power is in low voltage
- Distributor near the feeding end is heavily loaded
- Consumers at the end of the feeders would face severe voltage fluctuations

## 2. Ring Main System
1. 2 or more paths between the power source and the consumer
2. Loop starts from the substation -> bus-bars -> loops through the consumers to be served -> back to the substation. 
**Advantages**
- Less copper/conductor material used
- More reliable
- Less Voltage fluctuations
**Disadvantages**
- Complex planning and design

# Terms used in Distribution Systems
## 1. Load
Electric power needed in KW or KVA
## 2. Demand
Load at the receiving terminals averaged over a period of time
## 3. Demand Interval
Period over which the load is averaged
## 4. Maximum Demand
Highest demand observed within a specific period of time
## 5. Demand Factor
$$
Demand Factor = \frac {Max Demand}{Total Load Connected}
$$
## 6. Diversified Demand ( Coincident Demand)
Demand of the composite group as a whole, of somewhat unrelated loads over a specified time.
## 7. Non-Coincident Demand
Sum of the demands of a group of loads where no restrictions on the interval to which each demand is applicable.
## 8. Load Factor
